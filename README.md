ECE-3223
========

Solutions for selected Microprocessor System Design (ECE-3223) assignments from Fall 2013.

Problem descriptions are from the instructor; solutions are from me (the TA).

All code is written for the [mbed LPC1768](http://mbed.org/platforms/mbed-LPC1768/) development platform, and compiles with [its online compiler](https://mbed.org/compiler/).
